  Scenario: Integrate Customer Webservice for Invoice Application
    Given I am an authorized customer of the Create customer REST API webservice,
    When I send a request to the customer webservice with the ‘POST’ HTTP method,
    Then the create customer  REST API should have status code 200
    And Respond Body should have id(randomly gen), name and email matching the POST request body
